# DAILY UI in Unity

![Alt text](./day014img.png?raw=true "Day 014 - Countdown Timer")

### About
The Daily UI challenge can be found at http://www.dailyui.co/

Originally I started the Daily UI project using only Sketch and limited myself to a 15-minute timebox.

About 3/4 of the way through creating 15-minute designs in Sketch (some I loved, some not so much), I wanted to make these interactable.  Looking for a way to practice my C# and Unity skills, this seemed like a good challenge and with 100 UI's, the project will be a substantial UI library.

### Setup
If this project is something you would like to see on your local machine as it currently stands, please install Unity:
